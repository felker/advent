* Initial environment setup, 12/11/17
There is a complicated set of package-management options for Haskell. There is
on-going development and debate regarding the optimal choices for a Haskell
development environment. 
- =brew install haskell-stack= was the first install step I used.
  - This includes the =cabal= package manager
  - But it did not include the =ghci= interpreter
- Therefore, I then also executed =brew cask install haskell-platform=
- Finally, I installed the IHaskell kernel for IPython notebooks
* Summary / glossary of options and tools:
- =ghc= compiles Haskell files, with extensions =.hs=
- =ghci= is the GHC interpreter, similar to the Python or IPython interpreters
  - Included only after =brew cask install haskell-platform=
- IHaskell is a Haskell kernel for IPython and can be used with Jupyter
  notebooks. It is hosted on a [[https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell][GitHub repo]].
